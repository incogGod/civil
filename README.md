# Civil App - Tool for Civil Engineers
Software tool to assist civil engineers in solving complex concrete mix design calculations. It significantly improve the the speed of the calculattion process by avoiding the need of going through multiple tables for reference and the makes the overall process hastle free.

## Objective
Concrete mix designing is the process of calculating the ratio of weight of contents needed to prepare the concrete mix, according to our requirements. The calculation process of mix designing is complex as we have to refer couple of Indan Standard codes ( IS 456, IS 10262) and many tables given in them in each step of the calculation. It is a difficult task for even an experienced practitioner to do the calculation by keeping all these tables and page numbers of the IS codes in mind as the clause and tables we should be considering may vary according to the exceptions in the values of each steps. This issue can be rectified by automating the calculation process after recieving the inputs from the user.
